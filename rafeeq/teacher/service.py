"""Starts the lecturer assistant inside the Rafeeq app and hands it to the routes.

    with open_teacher_service() as service:   # in rafeeq/main.py's lifespan
        app.state.teacher = service

Startup never needs an LLM key, so the other members can run Rafeeq without one.
The graph is built on the first generation request; a missing key gives a clear 503 then.

Memory: Rafeeq's DATABASE_URL (Postgres) when it is reachable. If it is not, the app still
starts with in-memory storage and the teacher page shows a warning that nothing is kept
after a restart.
